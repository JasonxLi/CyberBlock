And sometimes the buttons to submit, clear, or suggest defenses would get cut off from the screen. Also with the chat feature, having to switch back and forth between all chat and team chat is tedious, maybe having two separate chat boxes would allow players to easily see between the two chats?",Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Simple and easy to follow,,"Overall good improvements! It's easier to tell when the team leader is switched and how points are earned for teams, along with easier to use chat features. However I think for the flow of the game it would be nice to have a screen saying ""starting next round"" that lets the players know that they are moving to the next round rather than just immediately loading the next screen. Perhaps a summary of the last round results would be helpful to show as well to maintain competitiveness. I think notifications would be a useful feature to add, especially for notifying a player that they have been switched to a different team or that a message popped up in chat just for easier indication."

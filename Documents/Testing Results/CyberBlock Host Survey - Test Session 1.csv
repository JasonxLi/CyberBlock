Also, information like who was the team leader often was not visible.  Might want to consider pinning some key information so it is easy to find/see.",Yes,The scrolling of the chat window should always show the latest chat at the bottom.,Option 1,Good instructions with a few improvements needed,"re. #14 I assume ""Option 1"" is really 'Yes""","Highlights
- pop-up with detailed description of defense

Issues ...
- encountered by players with joining i.e., joining late, re-joining the game
- players appearing twice if they re-joined
- players being dropped / frozen  
- purchased defenses not available for the team to play each round
- update color scheme (green/red) used in purchase round selections 
- highlight who is the current team leader on a team
- host can not advance to the next round until every team has submitted their defenses",Yes,Sometimes
2022/03/10 6:47:25 PM CST,Peter Mansbacher 104404535,Game Three,,,,,Yes,Can't easily see who is on your team or when the leader change's part way through,Sometimes,,,Can't change answers after selecting both,Round One,Round One;Round Two;Round Three;Round Four;Round Five,Round One;Round Two;Round Three;Round Four;Round Five,"After we picked defenses for first game, something went wrong and we didn't really make it to round 1",Sometimes,"Confusing at first about getting answers right and wrong, understood later on seeing the red check mark",4,Just Right,,,,2,Yes,Yes,"When I have the screen halfway out horizontally, I cant reach the send chat button. Also, chat button can send even if nothing in it. ",No,"Host should be able to see all chats. Also, remove jargon or give definitions for jargon/ train players first",Option 1,Confusing at points but was able to get through it,"Good job so far, still some work to do, but definitely coming together.

2022/03/10 6:49:53 PM CST,Eric Slick,Game Two;Game Three,,,,,Yes,"It was easy to tell as the player, but the UI for the host was kinda ugly.",Yes,,,It was hard to see sometimes because the game would move on quickly and you're forced to scroll down to it to see them.,Round One,Round One;Round Two;Round Three;Round Four;Round Five,Round One;Round Two;Round Three;Round Four;Round Five,,Yes,"Some answers seemed to give less points? Not sure why that was, maybe it was a setting but it wasn't exactly clear.",1,Too Small,,,,4,No,No,"Some of the attacks used acronyms which if you're trying to train people in cybersecurity they won't know them. Also, some with a brief () explanation didn't really clear anything up.",Yes,"I guess maybe it's based on host settings but we didn't really have time to effectively chat about our decisions. Also, the chat really needs the enter button to work.",Option 1,The instructions were not helpful,"The instructions didn't really explain anything, they just detailed the step by step of what you should do but all of that is pretty clear through just reading buttons/input boxes. It would have been much more helpful to have information regarding things like ""the game will switch leaders during defense selection"" because we didn't even know that until halfway through the last game.","I think it's a cool concept. It needs a lot of improvement on user experience, for instance the scoreboard should be clearer, which team you're on should be clearer (I don't think it's there at all), the fact that the team lead is changing and who is the new team lead should be clearer, etc. If you're going to make a game, you want people to be focused on playing it more than figuring out how to play it.",Yes,No

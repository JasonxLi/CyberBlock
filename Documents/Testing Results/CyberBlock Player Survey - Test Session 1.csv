I did enjoy having the crown :)",Sometimes,Yes,Yes,"I do like the chat, just to incorporate some of the comments, it would be nice for the suggestion box to work consistently and be available during the actual rounds as well. Additionally, it would be nice for the chat to automatically be at the newest chat rather the the top of the chat.",Yes,Simple and easy to follow,,"It would be nice for the rounds to tell you how many options you can choose. Additionally, if the team leader's background could be a different color than white, that would be cool-- Just giving more attention to when you are leader in a simple way (no reading required lol). Otherwise, I think you guys did a great job!",Yes,"We were able to click accurately, but the big issue was not having all of our selected choices.",Yes,Yes
2022/03/10 12:29:29 PM CST,Jeannine Looney,Game Two;Game Three,,,,,No,No,No,,"I am not sure if we skipped the trivia round... I don't remember doing that but I was late to game 1.  After being late, I was added to a team but could not chat with them or see the attacks and defenses.",No,,,,I didn't participate in a trivia round.,,,4,Just Right,,,,4,Yes,No,"By only being able to play 2 defenses and having limited defenses purchased, I often did not have a defense the would work on the attack and for the 2 rounds I played, we earned no points.",No,Sometimes,No,"It seems like some players chat messages were not showing up.  If we relied on this for making decisions, it would be difficult.",Yes,Confusing at points but was able to get through it,Still some bugs to work out but I can see the potential!,It would be helpful (if only for troubleshooting) to be able to see what remains in your wallet after you submit your defense purchases.  I was not sure if what I actually bought added up to what I thought was in my cart.  ,No,1st game - I cam late and could not join  2nd game - I selected defenses to spend all my money but I didn't get any of them while on team 4.  3rd game (on;y 2 teams) I was able to spend all my money and got all of my defenses.  It almost looked like I bought 1 more defense than I selected (I counted 8 but got 9).  This could have been a counting error on my part but should be further explored.,Yes,No
2022/03/10 12:40:39 PM CST,Debra Parcheta,Game One,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,"We did not see a trivia question in games 2 and 3, the attacks started.  The trivia question for 1:  my team leader did not get my chat so he picked the wrong answer.",Yes,,,,"We could not all answer questions, at the final screen all teams had zero points.",,,1,Just Right,,,,1,No,No,"So many problems with things not working that we really did not play a full game.  The first response or the first team responding gets a more accurate representation but anyone who is 2nd 3rd or 4th is not allowed to see all choices, host cannot start the game when the 4th team gets no defenses even after they selected defenses and submitted them.  When we reduced it to 2 teams the defenses were still wrong for the team that responded second.",Sometimes,Sometimes,No,Chat just didn't work well enough for us to collaborate.  My chats didn't show up.,No,Could not play the game,Instructions might be ok if the features worked but we could not progress at all.,"I could complete NO games, question above would not let me submit unless I lied to you and said 1, 2, or 3.  I cannot rank competitiveness:  we could not get through even buying defenses so that we could compete.  We could not all respond to attacks, some teams could not submit, some players were kicked out.  Rejoining the game dumps you into another team.  The host cannot move you to your correct team from here.  When I press enter in the chat window, I want it to send my text. Check boxes for choosing defense turned red and players thought there was a problem.  Red is a warning, incorrect or fail color.  My suggested defenses did not populate in the chat.  It said I made a suggestion but nothing was listed.  We should show our selected defenses for each team in alphabetical order.  Some users experienced a blank screen.  Refreshing makes you rejoin the game, you are in the wrong team, then when it moves to an attack you get no defenses and there is no longer a team leader at the top so you know that you are not actually in a team.  From there, all you can do is leave.  Rejoining again allowed me to join 3 teams but nothing worked for me after that - I was waiting for the host to start the game while I could see I was on 3 teams.   This survey and your tests need to get much much much more detailed.  I should be able to send you screen shots.",No,"Teams could spend all or less, but the defenses were not actually purchased in the next screen.",Yes,No

Would be nice to have the defenses the team mates suggest highlighted for the team leader to know. ",Yes,Sometimes,Yes,The chat does not automatically move to the last comment. which makes it hard for the player to stay up to date. The team chat did not always work.,Yes,Simple and easy to follow,,,Yes,"We were able to spend the money, but the defenses did not show up as available to use after the purchase was concluded.",Yes,Yes
2022/03/10 2:10:40 PM CST,Matthew Vorhees,Game Two;Game Three,,,,,No,No,No,,,Yes,,,,,,,2,Just Right,,,,4,Yes,Yes,I liked the overall user interface.  Only comment I have is that the IFU control had 'N/A' for a description that should be updated with more text / detail.,Yes,Sometimes,Yes,Team chat didn't work in the lobby.  Sometimes recommendations for non-leader team members didn't show up quite right or at all in the Team chat.,Yes,Simple and easy to follow,,"When I was appointed as a new team leader during the Attack simulations, my Submit button was still grayed out.

Also seemed like when there was more than 2 teams, whichever team bought their controls first got them all but subsequent teams could only buy 2 - 3 controls even though they selected more and had money for more.",Yes,,Yes,Yes

Should be alphabetical order (defenses)
Timer is starting to fast
I want to see who was on my teammates
Team scores did not change after certain rounds 
Jumped to a different round without the leader picking an option 
Did not notice the team leader is changing 
Submit button does not work sometimes
On safari it can does not see the timer when you are team leader 
It will be nice to notified when the team leader changes

2022/03/10 6:49:39 PM CST,James Mortensen,Game One;Game Two,,,,,No,No,No,,,Yes,,,,Could not figure out how points were awarded — on one question our team received 7 points for two right defenses and on the next we received 1 point for two right defenses,,,4,Just Right,,,,3,Yes,Yes,Auto-scrolling to bottom of chat would be nice so that you can always see most recent message. “Enter” to send chat would be nice too instead of having to click on send icon,Yes,Yes,Yes,Chat feedback above^,Yes,Simple and easy to follow,,,Yes,Did not test what happened if there was remaining money unspent,Yes,Yes
2022/03/10 6:49:40 PM CST,Fernando Campos,Game Two,,,,,No,No,No,,I didn't know we can gain extra points through the trivia round,No,,,,Difficult to understand which questions we got right and which ones we got wrong,,,4,Just Right,,,,2,No,No,"on some rounds, the team leader would automatically change. Also its difficult to see what defenses do when playing actual rounds. Would be nice to have tooltips during the game similar to the buy phase portion of the game",Sometimes,Sometimes,Yes,I liked how you could give suggestions to your team leader during the buy phase. Wish you could also give suggestions during the game rather than typing out the defense options in chat,Yes,Good instructions with a few improvements needed,A lot of features that I could have used were not listed in the instructions. Would  be nice to know what features I can use rather than figuring it out during the game,"each team submitted defenses but host cannot start the game on game 1
would be nice to send message by hitting enter
on team creation, cannot chat to team
would be nice for scroll icon in chat to auto scroll
would be nice to know who teamates are
cant unselect defense if I want to
selected defense from last round stays on the next round
team leader switched on round 3
hard to tell when a round ends, round ends abruptly
it would be nice to send suggested defenses in chat during a round
no round number, a lot of trivia
earnings show $60 instead of $45 on game 3
two scroll bars on the right side make it difficult to navigate
would be nice to automatically scroll down to selected defenses",No,"On game 1, we submitted all of our defenses but it showed that we had $1 left. This didn't allow the host to start the game",Yes,Sometimes
2022/03/10 6:50:24 PM CST,Ryan Cheng,Game Two;Game Three,,,,,No,No,Yes,,"I think one trivia question might have been skipped for game 3, results did not show and it redirected immediately to the next question",Yes,,,,It was unclear why some answers were worth more than others,,,2,Just Right,,,,2,No,Yes,Some issues with the UI made the game difficult to play and understand,Yes,Yes,Sometimes,"Chat was responsive, but there were issues such as being able to send empty message, not being able to hit enter to send a message, and text formatting. Recommendation text should be a different color font.",Yes,Confusing at points but was able to get through it,Ran into some UI issues that weren't covered in the instructions,"Full notes:

Test 1
- Team 2 bought defenses, but it all showed under team 1
- One team 2 member was not redirected and both teams submitted
- The host wasn't able to start the cyberblock game after trivia
- List of team members should be constantly listed
- You should be able to hit enter to send message instead of clicking the button
- Team chat doesn't work until starting game

Test 2
- Share suggestions text formatting seems to break with long
suggestion strings
- Suggestion text color should be different
- Time should not start immediately
- Amount of defenses should be shown
- Notification should show when team leader changes
- Winner for round 2 was not shown
- Round 3 results didn't show
- Submit button shouldn't show for team members
- Interface is identical for team members and team leader

Test 3
- Blank text is sent if you don't type anything
- Chat formatting
- Results redirect too quickly
- Pop-up message should show when both teams submit",Yes,"For game 1, the defenses bought by team 2 were added to team 1 and the game did not start",Yes,Sometimes

2022/03/10 6:56:55 PM CST,Matthew Nguyen,Game Two;Game Three,,,,,No,No,No,,"In later games, you can suggest answers i.e. defense purchases. Users should also be able to suggest their answers here. Also, users can suggest nothing and the chat box can easily be filled up(especially if there's someone whose trolling). Also, hitting Enter doesn't work in the chat. Also in the main lobby, teams aren't capable of messaging each other.",Yes,,,,"There's a red check mark to see which team won and the answers they selected, but it happens so quick(We're taken to the next round) that some of us didn't know who won until we figured it out afterwards. It would have been nice to see how the point system works and maybe even a pop up on which team won that round.",,,3,Just Right,,,,4,No,Yes,There's 3 scroll bars otherwise I like it.,Yes,Sometimes,Sometimes,"As mentioned above, teams aren't capable of messaging one another in the main lobby. Also, hitting enter doesn't work and one can easily spam the chat box. Then you can't suggest answers in the Trivia questions part of the game.",No,Good instructions with a few improvements needed,,"These are the notes I took:
lobby-2367.
It would be nice to see other team members in my team throughout the games. One can easily forget.
All user's weren't redirected to see the defenses each team bought.
We did not finish the games in this lobby.

lobby-5539
can't press enter to send a msg
can't send msg to my team in lobby 
I can't suggest my answer for the first trivia question

When the select your defense game starts:
Gives me anxiety before I know what I'm doing. Timer is a minute and the group didn't know what to do.
Of the 5 rounds, there's a red checkmark at the end and team 1 won.
We have a short amount of team to see and don't know how the point system work
we don't know when team lead changes is a big deal too.

lobby-99
Things went better this time around.",Yes,,Yes,Yes
2022/03/10 6:59:41 PM CST,Faisal Ashour,Game Two;Game Three,,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,,It was confusing we couldn't really tell when we gained points. ,Yes,,,,It was kind of confusing. It was hard to figure out what team you were on and a lot of actions did not really have enough feedback like submitting answers. ,,,1,Just Right,,,,2,Yes,No,The user interface could use some work.There is no way to tell what team your on or easily see who is a member of your team. It's hard to tell when a team leader changes during a round. ,Sometimes,Yes,Yes,The chat did not work in the lobby but did work once the game started.  You can't hit enter to send messages. You can send blank messages in chat. ,No,Confusing at points but was able to get through it,The instructions were kind of long. It might be nice if you broke it up with some pictures or maybe some headers. ,There is also seems to be a bug sometimes when picking defenses because we could not finish a game. It was stuck on the page where teams selected defenses and all the defenses were placed under team 2 and no defenses were showing for team 1. ,Yes,,Yes,Sometimes
